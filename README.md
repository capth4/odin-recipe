# odin-recipe

In this project, I created a list of my favorite recipes.
Each recipe has its own link that leads to a seperate page with the ingredients and instructions.

The skills demonstrated include:
1.Setup the Boilerplate.
2.Use tags to create a link to another page.
3.Use tags to display an image on the page.
4.Use both sorted and unsorted lists.
